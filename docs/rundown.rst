Rundown of ``ansible-sign`` (CLI) usage
=======================================

For Ansible Automation Platform content developers (project maintainers), the
primary and supported way of using **ansible-sign** is through the command-line
interface that comes with it.

The command-line interface aims to make it easy to use cryptographic technology
like GPG_ to validate that specified files within a project have not been
tampered with in any way.

Though in the future other means of signing and validating might be supported,
GPG is the only current supported means of signing and validation. As such, the
rest of this tutorial assumes the use of GPG.

The process of creating a GPG public/private keypair for signing content is well
documented online, such as in this `Red Hat "Enable Sysadmin" blog post`_. As
such, we will assume that you have a valid GPG keypair already available and in
your default GnuPG keyring.

You can verify that you have a keypair with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Verifying that a valid secret GPG key exists for signing content

   $ gpg --list-secret-keys

If the above command produces no output, or one line of output that says that a
"trustdb" was created, then you do not have a secret key in your default
keyring. If it produces output other than that, then you have a valid secret key
and are ready to move on!

The Project Directory
=====================

We will start with a simple Ansible project directory. The `Ansible
documentation`_ goes into more sophisticated examples of project directory
structures.

In our sample project, we have a very simple structure. An ``inventory`` file,
and two small playbooks under a ``playbooks`` directory.

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Our sample project

   $ cd sample-project/
   $ tree -a .
   .
   ├── inventory
   └── playbooks
       ├── get_uptime.yml
       └── hello.yml

   1 directory, 3 files

.. note::

   Future commands that we run will assume that your Working Directory is the
   root of your project. ``ansible-sign project`` commands, as a rule, always
   take the project root directory as their last argument, thus we will simply
   use ``.`` to indicate the current Working Directory.

Signing Content
===============

The way that ``ansible-sign`` protects content from tampering is by taking
checksums (sha256) of all of the secured files in the project, compiling those
into a checksum manifest file, and then finally signing that manifest file.

Thus, the first step toward signing content is to create a file that tells
``ansible-sign`` which files to protect. This file should be called
``MANIFEST.in`` and live in the project root directory.

Internally, ``ansible-sign`` makes use of the ``distlib.manifest`` module of
Python's distlib_ library, and thus ``MANIFEST.in`` must follow the syntax that
this library specifies. The Python Packaging User Guide has an `explanation of
the MANIFEST.in file directives`_.

For our sample project, we will include two directives. Our ``MANIFEST.in`` will
look like this:

.. code-block::
   :caption: ``MANIFEST.in``

   include inventory
   recursive-include playbooks *.yml

With this file in place, we can generate our checksum manifest file and sign
it. These steps both happen in a single ``ansible-sign`` command.

.. code-block::
   :caption: Generating a checksum manifest file and signing it

   $ ansible-sign project gpg-sign .
   GPG signing successful!
   Checksum manifest: ./.ansible-sign/sha256sum.txt
   GPG summary: signature created

Congratulations, you've now signed your first project!

Notice that the ``gpg-sign`` subcommand lives under the ``project``
subcommand. For signing project content, every command will start with
``ansible-sign project``. As noted above, as a rule, every ``ansible-sign
project`` command takes the project root directory as its final argument.

.. hint::

   As mentioned earlier, ``ansible-sign`` by default makes use of your default
   keyring and looks for the first available secret key that it can find, to sign
   your project. You can specify a specific secret key to use with the
   ``--fingerprint`` option, or even a completely independent GPG home directory
   with the ``--gnupg-home`` option.

.. note::

   If you are using a desktop environment, GnuPG will automatically pop up a
   dialog asking for your secret key's passphrase. If this functionality does
   not work, or you are working without a desktop environment (e.g., via SSH),
   you can use the ``-p``/``--prompt-passphrase`` flag after ``gpg-sign`` in the
   above command, which will cause ``ansible-sign`` to prompt for the password
   instead.

If we now look at the structure of the project directory, we'll notice that a
new ``.ansible-sign`` directory has been created. This directory houses the
checksum manifest and a detached GPG signature for it.

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Our sample project after signing

   $ tree -a .
   .
   ├── .ansible-sign
   │   ├── sha256sum.txt
   │   └── sha256sum.txt.sig
   ├── inventory
   ├── MANIFEST.in
   └── playbooks
       ├── get_uptime.yml
       └── hello.yml

Verifying Content
=================

If you come in contact with a signed Ansible project and want to verify that it
has not been altered, you can use ``ansible-sign`` to check both that the
signature is valid and that the checksums of the files match what the checksum
manifest says they should be. In particular, the ``ansible-sign project
gpg-verify`` command can be used to automatically verify both of these
conditions.

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Verifying our sample project

   $ ansible-sign project gpg-verify .
   Signature validation SUCCEEDED!
   Verification of checksum file succeeded.

.. hint::

   Once again, by default ``ansible-sign`` makes use of your default GPG
   keyring to look for a matching public key. You can specify a keyring file
   with the ``--keyring`` option, or a different GPG home with the
   ``--gnugpg-home`` option.

If verification fails for any reason, some information will be printed to help
you debug the cause. More verbosity can be enabled by passing the global
``--debug`` flag, immediately after ``ansible-sign`` in your commands.

Notes About Automation
======================

In environments with highly-trusted CI environments, it is possible to automate
the signing process. For example, one might store their GPG private key in a
GitHub Actions secret, and import that into GnuPG in the CI environment. One
could then run through the signing workflow above within the normal CI
workflow/container/environment.

When signing a project using GPG, the environment variable
``ANSIBLE_SIGN_GPG_PASSPHRASE`` can be set to the passphrase of the signing
key. This can be injected (and masked/secured) in a CI pipeline.

``ansible-sign`` will return with a different exit-code depending on the
scenario at hand, both during signing and verification. This can also be useful
in the context of CI and automation, as a CI environment can act differently
based on the failure (for example, sending alerts for some errors but silently
failng for others).

These codes are used fairly consistently within the code, and can be considered
stable:
